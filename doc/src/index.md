# DataKnots.jl

*DataKnots aspires to be a Julia library for representing
and querying data, including nested and circular
structures. DataKnots will provide integration and
analytics across CSV, JSON, XML and SQL data sources with
an extensible, practical and coherent algebra of query
combinators.*

At this time, while we welcome feedback and contributions,
DataKnots is not yet usable for general audiences.
